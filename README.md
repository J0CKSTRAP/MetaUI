# Q&A 

## Where is Metal located?

### It's located at `%appdata%\Local\Bloxstrap` with all the folders: IE. `workspace, autoexec, etc`

## What do I do if and when Metal Updates. 

### Run the "RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe" Metal Bootstrapper provided in the **[Discord](https://discord.gg/83YWxpYmmG)** in `#downloads`
### and it will pull the latest update off my github and parent it nice and neatly for you in `%appdata%\Local\Bloxstrap`

## Why does the editor / UI not load in, How can I fix it. 

### You most likely don't have Microsoft Edge Webview2 installed on your pc.
### Install it for **[here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?ch=1&form=MA13LH)** (scroll down & install Evergreen Bootstrapper), and see if that fixes your editor / UI not loading in.

## When I injected the command prompt that is supposed the stay open close after I inject?. 
### You are probably inside the game, Metal V3 does not fully support ingame injection yet and can be really buggy 
### and that is PageGuard's method of not hard crashing roblox and not getting it detected so inject in to the app and then join a game.

## What does the `RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe" file that is provided do?
### It runs the Metal Bootstrapper which updates your injector to the latest version then launches Roblox via Bloxstrap then runs the injector
